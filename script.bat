# The simpler way to run this script is to simply supply the branch
# name whose commits you want to cherry-pick into your current branch.
# For instance, if you want to cherry-pick the commits from branch
# `bar' of remote `foo' that do not exist in your current branch you
# would use the following:
#
# quickpick foo/bar
#
# or
#
# quickpick -s foo/bar
#
# to include your sign off.

# The second way to use this script is to specify two branches: the
# base and the feature.  In this case the base is the branch, other
# than the current branch, to compare with the feature branch.  This
# mode will use git cherry to pull out those commit in feature branch
# that do not exist in base.  This is useful if you're trying to merge
# commits into a branch that does not share a common history with
# feature branch.  Let's say that our branch, local, is based on a
# fork of the master at some point in the past, and feature branch is
# based on the current master branch.  We want to pull the new commits
# from feature into our local branch without getting the commits
# common to the master and feature branch that are not in our local
# branch.  We do that by running this command in a checkout of our
# local branch:
#
# quickpick master feature

# Should you run into a conflict while cherry-picking, you would
# resolve in the usual way.  Should you still have outstanding commits
# left to pull in, you may pickup where you left off by using the
# special argument `--continue.'  Even if you believe that your
# conflict occurred in the final cherry-pick, it won't hurt to use the
# --continue argument as a precaution against missing any commits.
# The script keeps track of the commits that have been cherry-picked
# as it runs, and so it would be safe to run --continue when there are
# none left.
